# Motivation
Do you spend hours standing in front of the mirror, thinking whether your fit is a slay or nay? Have you ever bought clothes online that do not fit you? More often than not, we waste precious time, effort, and money deciding on clothes that do not fit or flatter our body type. Furthermore, unsuccessful online purchases increase our carbon footprint as it increases the number of clothes that need to be produced, shipped, and ultimately discarded.  

Through a clothing fitting app, users are able to try on an entire outfit, from head to toe, without ever stepping foot in a dressing room. Our app allows users to see exactly how different pieces of clothing will fit and look on you. You can experiment with different colors, patterns, and styles, and even mix and match items to create your own unique looks. 
 

# Aim
We hope to make an app that helps users pick their outfits, and guide users in making better online shopping decisions when buying clothes. 


# User Stories
- As a user who has trouble deciding what to wear, I want to be able to receive recommendations for outfits based on my personal fashion style.  
- As a user who has no time and energy to try out different sets of clothes, I want to be able to set how different pieces of clothing will match one another and how they will fit on my body type.
- As a user who has trouble remembering her slay and nay fits, I would want to be able to store and view all my favourite outfits.

# Features
TheLazyCloset is an app that helps users pick their outfits. Users get creative in the creative space where they can choose clothing items and build their outfit on their own bodies. 

1. Users upload a full-body picture from which the app will auto-crop out their full body and use it as the outfit-building base. 
2. Users can upload images of clothing and the app will auto-crop out the clothing. 
3. Users have to create their own album & sub-album to categorise their clothing. (eg. tops, bottoms, dresses) 
4. The cropped clothing will be stored in the userâ€™s album(s) of choice.
5. In the creative space, users choose clothing items from the albums to lay over the base. The items can be resized.
6. Users can create outfit collections and save their outfits into their collection(s) of choice. (eg. work, casual, date)
7. Users can favourite or blacklist outfits. 
8. TheLazyCloset has an outfit recommendations page that users can browse through for inspiration.
